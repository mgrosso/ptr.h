TODO:

    - add the atomic test and set for more platforms; the next two platforms
      that make sense would be macosx and solaris sparc.  Those platforms
      work without it, but performance matters.

    - add examples in test of using ptr managed objects with stl containers and
      algorithms.  I havent found the right combination of adapter doohickies
      to make ptr<> and foreach<> to play nicely yet; it might be necessary to
      write some specialized versions of the usual stl adaptor functions or
      functors to make that work.

    - add an autoconf that would install the .h and .i somewhere rather than
      requiring the developer to copy ptr files into the project. This will
      require adding a library for the Semaphore class or else bringing it
      inline as well.

    - whatever changes necessary for ptr to conform to the boost proposed
      standard smart_ptr and then be submitted to boost.org. I've been putting
      this off since it seems like learning their Martian build system would
      involve actual effort.
