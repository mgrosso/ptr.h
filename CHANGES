Release 1.1 differs from 1.0 mainly in that the code has been cleaned up for
readability. Other changes include better solaris portability ifdefs and the
addition of the array operator, which just calls [] on the T*.

Release 1.0 in 2003 was the first public release, however, this code was
written in 1998, and has been in continuous production use since 1999.
