To use ptr.h in a project other than libframe, the steps are pretty simple:

    change or drop the line #include "frame_config.h"

    build the test programs and make sure they work using your projects 
    compiler and platforms.

    add ptr.h, PtrSemaphore.h, and PtrSemaphore.i to a convenient include
    directory for your project.

    add PtrSemaphore.cpp or Semaphore.cpp to a convenient src directory
    for your project.
